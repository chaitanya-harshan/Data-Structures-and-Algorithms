    /*
     * There is a frog on the '1st' step of an 'N' stairs long staircase. 
     * The frog wants to reach the 'Nth' stair. 'HEIGHT[i]' is the height of the '(i+1)th' stair.
     * If Frog jumps from 'ith' to 'jth' stair, the energy lost in the jump is given by absolute value of ( HEIGHT[i-1] - HEIGHT[j-1] ). 
     * If the Frog is on 'ith' staircase, he can jump either to '(i+1)th' stair or to '(i+2)th' stair. 
     * Your task is to find the minimum total energy used by the frog to reach from '1st' stair to 'Nth' stair.
      For Example
      If the given ‘HEIGHT’ array is [10,20,30,10], the answer 20 as the frog can jump from 1st stair to 2nd stair (|20-10| = 10 energy lost) and then a jump from 2nd stair to last stair (|10-20| = 10 energy lost). So, the total energy lost is 20.

 * Geek Jump
 Geek wants to climb from the 0th stair to the (n-1)th stair. At a time the Geek can climb either one or two steps. A height[N] array is also given. Whenever the geek jumps from stair i to stair j, the energy consumed in the jump is abs(height[i]- height[j]), where abs() means the absolute difference. return the minimum energy that can be used by the Geek to jump from stair 0 to stair N-1.

Input: n = 4, height = {10 20 30 10}
Output: 20
Explanation:
Geek jump from 1st to 2nd stair(|20-10| = 10 energy lost). Then a jump from the 2nd to the last stair(|10-20| = 10 energy lost). So, total energy lost is 20 which is the minimum.
