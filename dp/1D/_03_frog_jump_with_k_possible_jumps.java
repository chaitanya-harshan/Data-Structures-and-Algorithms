 * GFG
 * Minimal Cost
 * There is an array arr of heights of stone and Geek is standing at the first stone and can jump to 
 * one of the following: Stone i+1, i+2, ... i+k stone, where k is the maximum number of steps that can be jumped and cost will be |hi-hj| is incurred, where j is the stone to land on. Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the Geek reaches the last stone.

Example:

Input: k = 3, arr[]= [10, 30, 40, 50, 20]
Output: 30
Explanation: Geek will follow the path 1->2->5, the total cost would be | 10-30| + |30-20| = 30, which is minimum
