     * Thought Process:
     * 1. Problem Understanding:
     *    - For each item i, we need to find the first item j after i where prices[j] <= prices[i]
     *    - The final price for item i will be prices[i] - prices[j]
     *    - If no such j exists, no discount applies
     * 
     * 2. Solution Using Monotonic Stack:
     *    - Process array from right to left
     *    - Stack maintains potential discount values in increasing order
     *    - For each price, pop larger values (they can't be discounts)
     *    - Top of stack will be the next smaller or equal value (the discount)
     * 
     * 3. Example: [8,4,6,2,3]
     *    - Start from right: [8,4,6,2,3]
     *                                 â†‘
     *    - Stack: [3]
     *    - Process 2: Stack: [2]  (3 popped as it's larger)
     *    - Process 6: Stack: [2,6]
     *    - Process 4: Stack: [2,4]  (6 popped as it's larger)
     *    - Process 8: Stack: [2,4,8]
     * 
     * Time: O(n), Space: O(n)

 * 1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop
 * 
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/final-prices-with-a-special-discount-in-a-shop/
 * 
 * Given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop.
 * There is a special discount for items in the shop:
 * If you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to 
 * prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i].
 * If there is no j, you will not receive any discount at all.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
 * Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
 * Explanation:
 * - For item 0: price = 8, first smaller/equal is 4, final price = 8-4 = 4
 * - For item 1: price = 4, first smaller/equal is 2, final price = 4-2 = 2
 * - For item 2: price = 6, first smaller/equal is 2, final price = 6-2 = 4
 * - For item 3: price = 2, no discount possible, final price = 2
 * - For item 4: price = 3, no discount possible, final price = 3
